# Data Mining Project
This notebook is the final project for data-mining course.
For this project we applied data-mining techniques with python's scikit-learn library.
The project consist:
1. **Data Exploration:**
    - statistics about the features
    - scatter plots for the features
    - correlation matrix
    - violinplot
2. **Feature Engineering:**
    - LDA
    - PCA
    - Modification for PCA
    - Feature Generation
3. **KNN**
    - Hyperparameter optimization
    - apply with different preprocessing
4. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
    - apply with different preprocessing
5. **Multilayer Perceptron:**
    - apply with different preprocessing 
6. **Boosting:**
    - Based on decision trees
    - Based on Gaussian Naive Bayes
7. **Evaluation**:
    - Confusion matrix
    - Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
